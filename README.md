# 🏥 Radiology WhatsApp Bot

This is a **Flask-based WhatsApp bot** designed to assist **radiologists** in recording and managing medical exam reports via **voice messages**. The bot:
- Allows doctors to specify an **exam type** before sending reports.
- **Stores voice messages** received via WhatsApp API.
- Supports **"URGENTE"** flagging to mark critical reports.
- Allows **"BORRAR"** to delete the last recorded report.

## **🛠️ How It Works**
1. **Doctors start by specifying an exam type** (e.g., *"Resonancia"*, *"Tomografía"*) in a text message.
2. The bot **stores the session** and considers all future voice messages as that exam type.
3. **Voice messages** are recorded and stored with the exam type in `medical_reports.csv`.
4. Doctors can send `"BORRAR"` to delete the **last recorded report**.
5. Doctors can send `"URGENTE"` to **mark the last recorded report as urgent**.

## **🚀 How to Set Up and Run**
### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### **2️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a **`.env`** file in the root directory and update it with your WhatsApp API credentials:

```ini
ACCESS_TOKEN=your_facebook_whatsapp_api_access_token
PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_whatsapp_phone_number_id
VERSION=v18.0  # Update this if needed
VERIFY_TOKEN=your_custom_verification_token
```
Replace `your_facebook_whatsapp_api_access_token` with your **WhatsApp API token**.

---

### **3️⃣ Run the Flask App**
Start the Flask application:
```bash
python run.py
```

---

### **4️⃣ Set Up a Public URL with Ngrok**
To receive messages from WhatsApp, you need a **public URL**. Use **Ngrok** to expose your local Flask server:

1. Open a new terminal and run:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```
2. Copy the **public HTTPS URL** (e.g., `https://abcd-1234.ngrok.io`).
3. Go to **Meta Developer Portal** → WhatsApp → Webhook settings.
4. Paste the **Ngrok URL** followed by `/webhook`:
   ```
   https://abcd-1234.ngrok.io/webhook
   ```
5. Set the **Verify Token** (must match the `VERIFY_TOKEN` in `.env`).
